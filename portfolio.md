Oil prices are a constant source of volatility, but what if we could identify oil price disruptions before they happen?

The energy market, especially the price of crude oil, is known for its volatility. Geopolitical events, market speculation, and supply-demand shifts can lead to unexpected price movements that impact businesses worldwide.

In this project, I’ve applied LSTM Autoencoders to detect anomalies in West Texas Intermediate (WTI) Crude Oil Prices, uncovering potential outliers and significant price shifts that could signal market disruption. 📉📈

🔍 Why is this important? 
Identifying these anomalies can offer valuable insights for energy traders, risk managers, and policymakers—allowing them to act swiftly to mitigate risks or capitalize on emerging opportunities.

🔑 Key Insights: 
✅ Early detection of oil price anomalies 
✅ Practical applications for market forecasting 
✅ A proactive approach to risk management
