**Adrian Dominguez Castro, PhD**

I am a **data scientist** with over a decade of experience in **Machine Learning**, **Data Analysis**, **Python programming**, and **Computational Chemistry**, I specialize in delivering impactful, data-driven solutions that bridge the gap between research and industry. My journey has been shaped by a strong foundation in academia, including a **PhD in Physics (Dr. rer. nat.)** from the **University of Bremen, Germany**, and **Postdoctoral Research** at **Vanderbilt University, USA**, where I led a project focused on applying Machine Learning to advance Computational Chemistry.


Iâ€™ve worked across five countries (**Cuba, Canada, The Netherlands, Germany, and the USA**), contributing to multidisciplinary projects and co-authoring peer-reviewed publications in machine learning, quantum chemistry, and computational simulations.
