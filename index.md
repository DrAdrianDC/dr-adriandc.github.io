**Adrian Dominguez Castro, PhD**

With over a decade of experience in **Machine Learning**, **Python**, **Quantitative Analytics**, and **Computational Chemistry**, I specialize in delivering impactful, data-driven solutions that bridge the gap between research and industry. My journey has been shaped by a strong foundation in academia, including a **PhD in Physics (Dr. rer. nat.)** from the **University of Bremen, Germany**, and **Postdoctoral Research** at **Vanderbilt University, USA**, where I led a project focused on applying Machine Learning to advance Computational Chemistry.

As the Founder and Principal Consultant of **ADC Scientific Consulting**, I work with organizations to apply **Data Science** and **Machine Learning** to real-world challenges in technology, quantitative finance, and other fields. My goal is to bridge the gap between cutting-edge research and practical, scalable solutions that drive measurable impact.

Iâ€™ve worked across five countries (**Cuba, Canada, The Netherlands, Germany, and the USA**), contributing to multidisciplinary projects and co-authoring peer-reviewed publications in machine learning, quantum chemistry, and computational simulations.

Beyond technical expertise, I bring a global perspective, a commitment to innovation, and a track record of collaboration across diverse teams and sectors. Whether it's building predictive models, software development, analyzing data trends, or implementing scalable machine learning solutions, I am passionate about leveraging data to drive insights and informed decision-making.
