## About Me

I am a **Machine Learning Researcher** working at the intersection of fundamental science and real-world AI systems. With a **Ph.D. in Physics** and a background in **Computational Chemistry**, I design and build scalable discovery systems using advanced **RAG architectures**, **agentic workflows (LangGraph)**, and automated pipelines for high-dimensional scientific data.

### Academic Foundation
My journey began with a **B.Sc. in Radiochemistry** from **InSTEC** – University of Havana (Cuba). I later earned my **Ph.D. in Physics (Dr. rer. nat.)** from the **University of Bremen** (Germany). During my **Postdoctoral Research at Vanderbilt University (USA)**, I led the integration of Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Machine Learning to predict material properties with over **85% accuracy**, translating molecular-scale simulations into scalable, data-driven systems.

### Global Impact & Research
I have conducted research and professional work across five countries (**Cuba, Canada, The Netherlands, Germany, and the USA**). My work has resulted in multiple peer-reviewed publications spanning machine learning, quantum chemistry, and computational simulations.

### Current Focus: AI for Science
Through my independent practice, **ADC Scientific Consulting**, I architect end-to-end AI solutions for venture studios and elite research organizations.

**Selected Engagement:** **Decimal.health — Venture Studio (AccelerOnc Studio, Moffitt Cancer Center)**

- **Architected RAG-based search systems** to enable discovery across complex clinical and scientific datasets.
- **Engineered robust data pipelines** to ensure data integrity and reliability for LLM-driven discovery in medical and scientific domains.
- **Developed agentic workflows** using **LangGraph** to automate high-fidelity data ingestion and scientific reasoning processes.

**Mission**  
My mission is to accelerate scientific discovery by building intelligent systems that bridge theoretical breakthroughs with production-grade AI engineering in high-stakes scientific and biomedical domains.
