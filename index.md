# About me

I am a **data scientist** with over a decade of experience in **Machine Learning**, **Data Analysis**, **Python programming**, and **Computational Chemistry**, I specialize in delivering impactful, data-driven solutions that bridge the gap between research and industry. My journey has been shaped by a strong foundation in academia, including a **PhD in Physics (Dr. rer. nat.)** from the **University of Bremen, Germany**, and **Postdoctoral Research** at **Vanderbilt University, USA**, where I led a project focused on applying Machine Learning to advance Computational Chemistry.


I’ve worked across five countries (**Cuba, Canada, The Netherlands, Germany, and the USA**), contributing to multidisciplinary projects and co-authoring peer-reviewed publications in machine learning, quantum chemistry, and computational simulations. 


As the Founder and Principal Consultant of 𝗔𝗗𝗖 𝗦𝗰𝗶𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗳𝗶𝗰 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘀𝘂𝗹𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴, I work with organizations to apply 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗦𝗰𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲 and 𝗠𝗮𝗰𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗲 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 to real-world challenges in technology, quantitative finance, and other fields. My goal is to bridge the gap between cutting-edge research and practical, scalable solutions that drive measurable impact.
