# About Me

I am a **Machine Learning Researcher** specializing in bridging the gap between fundamental science and real-world applications. With a **Ph.D. in Physics** and a background in **Computational Chemistry**, I focus on building scalable discovery systems through advanced **RAG architectures**, **AI Agents (LangGraph)**, and automated pipelines for high-dimensional scientific data.

### Academic Foundation
My journey began with a **B.Sc. in Radiochemistry** from **InSTEC** – University of Havana (Cuba). I later earned my **Ph.D. in Physics (Dr. rer. nat.)** from the **University of Bremen** (Germany). During my **Postdoctoral Research at Vanderbilt University** (USA) I led the integration of Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Machine Learning to predict material properties with over 85% accuracy, translating complex molecular modeling into scalable data-driven insights.

### Global Impact & Research
I have conducted research and work across five countries (**Cuba, Canada, The Netherlands, Germany, and the USA**). My work has resulted in multiple peer-reviewed publications in machine learning, quantum chemistry, and computational simulations.

### Current Focus: AI for Science
As a **Scientific Consultant** , I architect end-to-end AI solutions for startups and elite research organizations. My recent work includes:

* **Architecting RAG Search Systems** for the **Moffitt Cancer Center** to optimize discovery in clinical and scientific datasets.
* **Engineering Robust Data Pipelines** that ensure integrity for LLM-based discovery in high-dimensional data.
* **Developing Agentic Workflows** using **LangGraph** to automate high-fidelity data ingestion and management.

My goal is to transform cutting-edge research into practical, robust engineering that drives measurable impact in the scientific community
