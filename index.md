## About Me

**AI & ML Engineer | AI Systems | LLMs & RAG | Ph.D.**


I build **production-ready AI systems** that turn complex scientific and high-dimensional data into actionable solutions. I specialize in **LLMs, RAG pipelines, LangChain / LangGraph, and automated ML workflows**, bridging advanced modeling with real-world applications.

## Current Focus: AI for Science
Through **ADC Scientific Consulting**, I architect **end-to-end AI solutions** for venture studios and research organizations, building **robust, scalable, and interpretable pipelines** for LLM-driven discovery.

### Selected Engagements
- **Decimal.health — Venture Studio (AccelerOnc, Moffitt Cancer Center)**
  - Architected RAG-based search systems for complex clinical and scientific datasets
  - Engineered automated pipelines for high-fidelity data ingestion
  - Developed agentic workflows using **LangGraph** to streamline scientific reasoning


## Academic Foundation
My journey began with a **B.Sc. in Radiochemistry** from **InSTEC – University of Havana (Cuba)**. I later earned my **Ph.D. in Physics** with a background in **Computational Chemistry** from the **University of Bremen (Germany)**. During my **Postdoctoral Research at Vanderbilt University (USA)**, I integrated advanced simulations with Machine Learning to create **scalable, data-driven AI systems**.


## Global Impact & Research
I have conducted research and professional work across five countries (**Cuba, Canada, The Netherlands, Germany, and the USA**). My work has resulted in multiple peer-reviewed publications spanning machine learning, quantum chemistry, and computational simulations.

**Mission**  
My mission is to accelerate scientific discovery by building intelligent systems that bridge theoretical breakthroughs with production-grade AI engineering in high-stakes scientific and biomedical domains.
