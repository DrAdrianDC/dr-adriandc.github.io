# About Me

[cite_start]I am a **Machine Learning Researcher** specializing in bridging the gap between fundamental science and production-grade AI[cite: 3]. [cite_start]With a **Ph.D. in Physics** and a background in **Computational Chemistry**, I focus on building scalable discovery systems through advanced **RAG architectures**, **AI Agents (LangGraph)**, and automated pipelines for high-dimensional scientific data[cite: 3, 26, 32].

### Academic Foundation
[cite_start]My journey began with a **B.Sc. in Radiochemistry** from InSTEC – University of Havana[cite: 27, 29]. [cite_start]I later earned my **Ph.D. in Physics (Dr. rer. nat.)** from the **University of Bremen**, Germany[cite: 26, 29]. [cite_start]During my **Postdoctoral Research at Vanderbilt University**, I led the integration of Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Machine Learning to predict material properties with over 85% accuracy, translating complex molecular modeling into scalable data-driven insights[cite: 14, 15].

### Global Impact & Research
[cite_start]I have conducted research across five countries (**Cuba, Canada, The Netherlands, Germany, and the USA**)[cite: 24]. [cite_start]My work has resulted in multiple peer-reviewed publications in machine learning, quantum chemistry, and computational simulations, focusing on enhancing processing efficiency and predictive accuracy in scientific workflows[cite: 21, 23].

### Current Focus: AI for Science
[cite_start]As a **Scientific AI Consultant** at **ADC Scientific Consulting**, I architect end-to-end AI solutions for venture studios and elite research organizations[cite: 8, 9]. My recent work includes:

* [cite_start]**Architecting RAG Search Systems** for the **Moffitt Cancer Center** to optimize discovery in clinical and scientific datasets[cite: 11, 12].
* [cite_start]**Developing Agentic Workflows** using **LangGraph** to automate high-fidelity data ingestion and management[cite: 32].
* [cite_start]**Engineering Robust Data Pipelines** that ensure integrity for LLM-based discovery in high-dimensional domains[cite: 13, 32].

[cite_start]My goal is to transform cutting-edge research into practical, robust engineering that drives measurable impact in the scientific community[cite: 3].
